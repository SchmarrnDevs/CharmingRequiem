# Charming Requiem

This Mod was tested with following Requiem / Charm versions:
 - Requiem `2.0.0-beta.9`
 - Charm `4.1.2`
Earlier or later versions might also work. 

This mod currently does something really simple:
It takes the Totem of Preserving from the `Charm` Mod and makes
it compatible with `Requiem` - Now, if you die while possessing a
mob, the totem will be dropped!
